{"name":"Savinet","tagline":"a mini social networking - follow and followers","body":"### Welcome to SAVINET.\r\nThe SAVINET is a Social networking Website which serves as an access point for Bloggers and anyone can create his profile, follow up other users who are  registered. It is based on MVC architecture and is mostly customizable. Besides following each other, users can upload audio files, raw documents to a limited size. Also, email notification (Invitation) is available. \r\n \r\nRecommending to install git-bash. Its much easier and simpler.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd savinet\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/imdadareeph/savinet.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designing\r\nAll designs were self created and have been done using web learning. Some images and third pary JS have also been used. All will be updated in due time. Currently thats all.\r\n\r\n### Having issues with deployment?\r\nFeel free to contact the developers. This was a very old code with no pattern. So do not complain about a bad way of doing it. Infact this was done during the learning phase of web application. A better version of it will be soon available which is done in Spring Hibernate JSF primefaces JQuery Mysql and some other Libraries.\r\n\r\n### Developers and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a Savinet username to generate a link to their profile.
