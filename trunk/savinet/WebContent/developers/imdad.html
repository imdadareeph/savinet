                <p class="em_text">I am a very simple guy, who is addicted to digital world. I dream of the future , everything bering digitized where there is peace and harmony and there is no scarcity of anything. Food home clothing are in abundance because of their digital forms. But this dream is yet to get fullfilled which seems a little unlikely. People would rather call my imagination to be a fools paradise, still i care the less.</p>
                <p>I write diary at night and that also helps me keep track of my daily activities. I am a musician. I play bass guitar in my band. In college I had the band named ABANDONED ALIANCE. Currently I am in the Band Called SHLOK. Last performance was in Oct 2010 in R.V. College fest. I like Cruzing in bike , long trips etc. I am an insomniac. Basically I like the night hours cause they are quite and provides and environment to achieve ideas and implement them according to my will. But that doesn't mean that I despise day time. But at day time if everything is made available to me, I can sit on my PC for whole day without any complains and do the jobs. </p>
